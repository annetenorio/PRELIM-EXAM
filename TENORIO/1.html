		<i>original poem by Anne Tenorio</i>
		
		<p>i can’t express this undenied loss of motivation.<br>
		<del>whether it may be a distraction or just no sense of direction.</del><br>
		I was on it, at first, I was completely on the game,<br>
		<strong>but in the long run i have no idea what made it foul and lost my name.</strong><br>
		<br>
		throughout the weekend, my bed just sucks me in.<br>
		<em>I can’t seem to let go, I just give in.</em><br>
		but what in the enigma of this feelings begin<br>
		<ins>should I allow myself to go down or should I rise up again?</ins><br>
		<br>
		I don’t want to feel the pressure of constantly expecting something to happen,<br>
		<b>sometimes it’s just better to make me feel stuffs rather than staying numb again.<b><br>
		I know it’s much harder to pretend it’s all okay,<br>
		sometimes I know I can find strength in all the delay.<br>
		<br>
		Once I look forward now, I have no energy to meet.<br>
		For I am so excited to be and so <sub>excited</sub> to see.<br>
		This is what most of people around my age hate,<br>
		<mark>But it’s the only thing I’m good at and I appreciate.</mark><br>
		<br>
		<sup>Nonetheless,</sup> I don’t have the energy to see,<br>
		I just feel anxious this day would come and I am in nowhere near as ready.<br>
		Notes unfinished, tasks unsubmitted<br>
		<small>How can I say I’m good at it, if I think I’m not committed?</small></p>
